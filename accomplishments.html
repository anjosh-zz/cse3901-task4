        <strong>Recent Accomplishments</strong>
        <p>A notable recent accomplishment in wireless sensor networks is <a
          href="http://www.cast.cse.ohio-state.edu/exscal/index.php?page=main">
          ExScal</a> which demonstrated a perimeter security application with
        over 1000 sensor nodes and over 200 802.11b backbone nodes spread
        over a 1.3km by 300m area. As of December 2004, ExScal was the
        largest wireless sensor network deployed and likely also the largest
        802.11b peer-to-peer ad hoc network deployed. The research led to the
        development of <a
          href="http://kansei.cse.ohio-state.edu/KanseiGenie/">Kansei</a>,
        which is an interactive, heterogeneous, large-scale wireless sensor
        network environment for testing and development. The stationary array
        of Kansei is housed in a warehouse near our Campus and presently
        contains over 700 sensor nodes supporting different hardware and
        software platforms. Other Kansei arrays are located in our department
        building, and supporting sensing for our in-building mobile
        peer-to-peer <a
          href="http://kansei.netlab.ohio-state.edu/peoplenet/index.php">People
          Net</a>, and being cloned nationwide as part of our effort to
        integrate Kansei with GENI experimentation infrastructure.</p>

        <p>In the last few years, we have collaborated actively with
        colleagues at UT at Austin, Iowa, Michigan State, Kent State, UC
        Berkeley, and MIT, as well as other university and industry partners
        (research resulting from our DARPA NEST project may be found in our
        <a href="http://nest.netlab.ohio-state.edu/">Stabilization in NEST
          page</a>) and with members of the Systems and Networking Group at
        Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA  (research resulting from the MSR
        Aladdin Home Networking Project may be found in the <a
          href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/siefast/group/publications.html">
          Publications page</a>). In 2003, we completed a smart-dust sensor
        network field experiment on <a href="">A Line in the Sand</a> for
        DARPA and a demonstration of continuous self-maintenance at the
        Microsoft Research Faculty Summit. Our more recent projects are in
        collaboration with the <a href="">Institute for Sensing Systems</a>
        at Ohio State, which I helped co-found (alongwith Randy Moses).</p>
